You are building a Systems Engineering course project and you wanted to do it in a structured, step by step way so you can satisfy the official deliverables and formatting requirements.

## What you are trying to achieve

You are trying to deliver a complete Systems Engineering project package for your theme, including:

* A 10 to 15 page written report with the required sections
* Annexes with WBS, Gantt and resource allocation, risk plan, and SysML diagrams
* A working implementation of the system or a significant representative module
* An 8 to 10 slide presentation designed for a 30 minute presentation plus Q and A

## Project description

Your project is called Email Order Processing Automation. It improves a manual process where orders arrive by email and staff copy information into an internal tracking system.

We defined the system as an automation that runs in UiPath Community and processes an Outlook inbox. It identifies order emails based on subject keywords, extracts order details from multiple supported email body formats, applies business rules to compute totals and estimated delivery date, saves attachments in a structured local folder, updates a local Excel restock file, sends a confirmation email back to the sender, moves the email into an outcome folder, and writes a CSV log record for audit.

## What you have provided in this chat

You provided the project identity and all technical rules needed to write the report and design the system:

* Title and team members
* Theme description and clarified it is an improvement project
* Outlook mailbox and UiPath Community as the platform
* A WBS diagram and a risk management plan spreadsheet
* The internal system is a local Excel restock spreadsheet with columns Product and TotalQty
* Scheduling is used, configured via a settings form
* Subject keyword detection is contains match and configurable
* High priority rule and delivery policy rules, all configurable
* The list of extracted fields and computed fields
* Supported email formats: labeled, CSV like, and pipe separated, with realistic sample emails
* Folder routing: Processed, HighPriority, NeedInfo, Failed, with NeedInfo sending a follow up request
* Logging format as CSV with a specific set of fields
* Project timeline and role allocation across the four team members
* QA metrics selection and measurement scenario
* Environment constraints: Windows 11, Outlook Classic, UiPath Studio Community 2026.0.182 STS, Excel installed
* Course context: UPB Systems Engineering
* Writing style requirements for the report: first person plural, natural language, no parentheses or special characters

## What you have achieved so far

By the end of the chat, you had a complete set of deliverables generated from your inputs:

* A full report in DOCX and PDF format
* A PowerPoint presentation deck with 9 slides for a 30 minute talk
* A complete APA references list that is real and aligned with the project topic
* A finalized scope, requirements content, QA metrics, risks, and diagram plan aligned with course requirements

## Key system behavior in one place

* Reads from Outlook account [orderemailsautomationrpa@outlook.com](mailto:orderemailsautomationrpa@outlook.com)
* Runs daily at 23:45 and only processes unread emails, up to 50 emails per run
* Detects orders using configurable keywords: order, purchase, invoice, PO
* Extracts: sender email, product name, quantity, unit price
* Computes: line total, order total, item count, and generates order ID from timestamp
* High priority if order total exceeds FastDeliveryMinPrice and quantity is within FastDeliveryMaxQuantity
* ETA logic:

  * High priority gives fast days
  * Large quantity gives slow days
  * Otherwise standard days
* Saves attachments to a local attachments folder with per email subfolders
* Updates local restock Excel file and appends quantities or adds new products
* Sends a confirmation email including ETA, items, total, and item list
* Moves emails into the correct outcome folder and logs each processed email to CSV

If you want next, you can tell me whether you also need a short speaking script for the 30 minute presentation and a one page executive summary for the report.
